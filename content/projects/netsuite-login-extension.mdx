While doing <ExternalLink to='https://www.netsuite.com/portal/home.shtml'>NetSuite</ExternalLink> 
(Oracle owned cloud ERP) consulting work for an employer of mine it was 
common practice for multiple consultants to leverage the same generic 
logins to access client accounts.

NetSuite user licenses are expensive and our company wanted to minimize 
the number of unique licenses we would have to use during the implementation 
process. So for each client we would make 1 to 3 generic accounts.

Each of the consultants working on this client (engineers, developers, 
financial analysts) would share these accounts to complete their various 
portions of the implementation.

<Text type='subheader2' emphasis='HIGH'>Logging Each Other Out</Text>

My coworkers and I, although many times working across multiple clients,
would inevitably log each other out on accident. In the NetSuite world 
this can result in drastic losses in effort/time on unsaved record edits.
Some cases were costing our company hours a day in interrupted progress.  

Of course you can recommend your employees save the records/work they are 
on often, but in practice this does little to mediate the problem and will 
still result in a frustrating experience for consultants.

<Text type='subheader2' emphasis='HIGH'>Access Control</Text>

We utilized a shared repository of client login information for these generic 
accounts. Inevitably, when an employee with access to this information left 
the company we would obviously need to change each and every password that 
user could have had saved to their machine and/or memory.  

In a consultancy this is far from ideal and with NetSuite is extremely 
inconvenient, not to mention a potential PII/security risk.

<Text type='subheader1'>Solutions</Text>

<Text type='subheader2' emphasis='HIGH'>Only admins have access to secure information</Text>
Admin users of the tool have access to add accounts, edit existing account information (including passwords).
All other users cannot see account passwords and only have access to accounts assigned to them.

<Text type='subheader2' emphasis='HIGH'>User login is simple and protected</Text>
When a user clicks to login to an account they have access to, a new, authenticated tab is opened for that account.
This is of course only the case if no one else is currently using the account, 
if so the user will be prompted prior to potentially logging the other person out.

<Text type='subheader2' emphasis='HIGH'>2FA Support</Text>
The tool also automatically generates 2FA tokens configured within each client account.

<Text type='subheader2' emphasis='HIGH'>Account use is visible and tracked</Text>
Each login event and its duration is tracked and visible, providing data with the potential to reveal useful analytics.
