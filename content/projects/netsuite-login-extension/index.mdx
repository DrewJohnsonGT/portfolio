    (Oracle owned cloud ERP) consulting work for an employer of mine it was
    common practice for multiple consultants to leverage the same generic logins
    to access client accounts.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
    NetSuite user licenses are expensive and our company wanted to minimize the
    number of unique licenses we would have to use during the implementation
    process. So for each client we would make 1 to 3 generic accounts.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
    Each of the consultants working on this client (engineers, developers,
    financial analysts) would share these accounts to complete their various
    portions of the implementation.

<NormalHeading>Logging Each Other Out</NormalHeading>
<PostImage src='loggin-warning.png' dir='netsuite-login-extension' />
<Paragraph>
    My coworkers and I, although many times working across multiple clients,
    would inevitably log each other out on accident. In the NetSuite world this
    can result in drastic losses in effort/time on unsaved record edits. Some
    cases were costing our company hours a day in interrupted progress.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
    Of course you can recommend your employees save the records/work they are on
    often, but in practice this does little to mediate the problem and will
    still result in a frustrating experience for consultants.
</Paragraph>
<NormalHeading>Access Control</NormalHeading>
<Paragraph>
    We utilized a shared repository of client login information for these
    generic accounts. Inevitably, when an employee with access to this
    information left the company we would obviously need to change each and
    every password that user could have had saved to their machine and/or
    memory.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
    In a consultancy this is far from ideal and with NetSuite is extremely
    inconvenient, not to mention a potential PII/security risk.
</Paragraph>
<MajorHeading>Solution</MajorHeading>
<NormalHeading>Only admins have access to secure information</NormalHeading>
<PostImage src='edit-account.png' dir='netsuite-login-extension' />
<Paragraph>
    Admin users of the tool have access to add accounts, edit existing account
    information (including passwords). All other users cannot see account
    passwords and only have access to accounts assigned to them.
</Paragraph>
<NormalHeading>User login is simple and protected</NormalHeading>
<Paragraph>
    When a user clicks to login to an account they have access to, a new,
    authenticated tab is opened for that account. This is of course only the
    case if no one else is currently using the account, if so the user will be
    prompted prior to potentially logging the other person out.

<NormalHeading>2FA Support</NormalHeading>
<Paragraph>
    The tool also automatically generates 2FA tokens configured within each
    client account.
</Paragraph>
<NormalHeading>Account use is visible and tracked</NormalHeading>

<Paragraph>
    Each login event and its duration is tracked and visible, providing data
    with the potential to reveal useful analytics.
