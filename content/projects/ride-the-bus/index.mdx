<Paragraph>
    I found myself wanting to play the card game{' '}
    <ExternalLink to='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ride_the_bus'>
        Ride the Bus
    </ExternalLink>
    , but did not have a pack of cards. So naturally I programmed the cards/game
    instead of making the 5 minute trip to the store to get new cards.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
    The game has 4 consecutive choices that must be made correctly in sequence
    to win:
</Paragraph>
<MajorHeading center>Red or Black</MajorHeading>
<Paragraph>Guess whether the first card is red or black</Paragraph>
<PostImage src='red-black.gif' dir='ride-the-bus' gif />
<MajorHeading center>Higher or Lower</MajorHeading>
<Paragraph>
    Then guess whether the second card is higher or lower than the first
</Paragraph>
<PostImage src='higher-lower.gif' dir='ride-the-bus' gif />
<MajorHeading center>In Between or Outside</MajorHeading>
<Paragraph>
    Next guess whether the third card is in between or outside of the first two
    cards
</Paragraph>
<PostImage src='inbetween-outside.gif' dir='ride-the-bus' gif />
<MajorHeading center>Suit</MajorHeading>
<Paragraph>Finally, guess the suit of the final card</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    I found playing cards to be a fun type abstraction to mesh with TypeScript.
    Also added a settings page where the speed of the game can be controlled.

<MajorHeading>TLDR</MajorHeading>
Fun little probability based card game. Was too lazy to buy a pack of cards...
Can be used as a drinking game ;)
