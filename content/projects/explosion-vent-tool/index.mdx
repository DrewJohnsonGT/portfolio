<Paragraph>
    A team of engineers at{' '}
    <ExternalLink to='https://www.schenckprocess.com/us'>
        Schenck Process
    </ExternalLink>{' '}
    are continuously designing complex manufacturing equipment dealing with
    potentially explosive particulate. They must adhere to a rigourous standard
    (

    ) in all relevant specifications and products. They were using a series of passed
    around excel sheets with 15 year old scripts to aid in this process.

<NormalHeading>Versioning</NormalHeading>
<Paragraph>
    The NFPA spec that the products had to follow is updated about twice a year.
    Every time this happened all of the teams utilizing the old sheets had to be
    distributed updated versions. This was often tedious and someone using an
    outdated version of the sheet could have catastrophic implications.
</Paragraph>
<NormalHeading>Maintainability</NormalHeading>
<Paragraph>
    15 years of Visual Basic was crammed into a dozen or so haphazard sheets
    with vaugue instructions. One director had the legacy knowledge and was
    capable of maintaining the sheets and logic.

<NormalHeading>Web App Configurator</NormalHeading>
<Paragraph>
    I developed an internally hosted web app tool to replicate the sheets
    functionality and more!

<NormalHeading>Admin Management</NormalHeading>
<Paragraph>
    The tool had admin provisioned access to update various tables of standard
    sized components. The admin portal also allowed for updating of mnarkdown
    rendered field and page help messages.

<NormalHeading>Results and Output</NormalHeading>
<Paragraph>
    Once the minimum input has been provided, the tool displays all relevant
    output and can generate a styled PDF with the results (mostly used by sales
    teams). Missing fields and cumulative results are displayed and updated live
    as users enter more data.

<NormalHeading>Changes and Requests</NormalHeading>
<Paragraph>
    Initial release brought minor change requests. One of the main ones was an
    option to view all variable values in one location, including intermiate
    calculation values. The new visibility and flexibility revealed a few needed
    adjustments in the equations used. These were made by the engineers in{' '}
    <ExternalLink to='https://www.mathcad.com/en'>MathCad</ExternalLink> and I
    quickly made updates to the tool.

<MajorHeading>TLDR</MajorHeading>
Highly complex configurator, utilizing standards based mathmatical equations/models to spec and size explosion vents for engineering and sales teams
.
