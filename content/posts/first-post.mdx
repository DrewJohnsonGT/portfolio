Hello! Welcome to the latest iteration of another software engineer's personal website/blog!

Inevitably this site is a place for me host my thoughts, ideas, and practice/side projects.

The tech stack is pretty straight forward:

 - <ExternalLink to='https://www.gatsbyjs.com/'>Gatsby & React</ExternalLink>  

    - Content pages are rendered from <ExternalLink to='https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-mdx/'>MDX</ExternalLink> files
    - React is in plain JavaScript (TypeScript felt unnecessary)
 - <ExternalLink to='https://styled-components.com/'>Styled-Components</ExternalLink>
 - <ExternalLink to='https://docs.netlify.com/functions/overview/'>Netlify Functions</ExternalLink>  
 
    - For contact form
 
The code can be found on my <ExternalLink to='https://github.com/DrewJohnsonGT/portfolio'>Github</ExternalLink>
